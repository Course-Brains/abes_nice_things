use std::convert::Infallible;
/// This is a type which is similar to [OpenOptions](std::fs::OpenOptions)
/// and is used to get input from the terminal.
/// The simplest way to use this is to just get input with no
/// message or condition:
/// ```no_run
/// # use albatrice::Input;
/// # fn main() {
/// let input: String = <Input>::new().get().unwrap();
/// # }
/// ```
/// As you may have noticed, we need to [unwrap](Result::unwrap)
/// the what is returned after we get input from the terminal.
/// In order to explain that I have to explain the various options
/// for this type.
/// # msg
/// You can define a message to be displayed every time
/// it attempts to get information from the terminal.
/// This message will be [printed](println) above where
/// they actually input data:
/// ```terminal
/// [Your message]
/// [where they would be typing]
/// ```
/// This message does have to be constant, but you can
/// define it after creating an [Input] instance
/// by using the [msg](Input::msg) method.
/// ```
/// # use albatrice::Input;
/// # fn main() {
/// <Input>::new().msg("Whatever you want");
/// # }
/// ```
/// Notably, if no message is provided,
/// running [get](Input::get) will not
/// cause a newline to be [printed](println),
/// meaning that it will not cause a gap such as
/// ```terminal
///
/// [where you type]
/// ```
/// to occur.
/// # cond
/// While being able to define a message is nice,
/// sometimes you need to restrict the possible
/// responses or sometimes getting the input
/// itself can fai to meet your conditions.
/// To allow this to happen, you can give a
/// closure that will be run with the [String]
/// given by the user as an input.
/// This closure must return either [Ok] containing
/// a bool indicating whether or not it is done
/// getting input. Specifically, if [true] is returned
/// by the closure, [get](Input::get) will return
/// [Ok] containing the string passed to the closure.
/// However, if [false] is returned by the closure,
/// it will re-attempt to get input from the terminal
/// and will re-send the message.
/// For instance, if only returning y or n was valid,
/// then this could be what would happen with the
/// message of "Give me y or n"
/// ```terminal
/// Give me y or n
/// I don't want to
/// Give me y or n
/// Y
/// Give me y or n
/// y
/// ```
/// As is shown, the the default condition given by
/// [yn](Input::yn) is case sensitive, which caused
/// it to only stop after being given exactly 'y' or
/// 'n' not 'Y' or 'N'. However, if you wanted to fix
/// this, you could make your own condition:
/// ```
/// # use albatrice::Input;
/// # fn main() {
/// <Input>::new().cond(& |string| {
///     match string.to_lowercase().as_str() {
///         "y"|"n" => return Ok(true),
///         _ => return Ok(false)
///     }
/// });
/// # }
/// ```
/// You can set either of them while chaining method
/// calls together because they all return &mut [Input]
/// ```no_run
/// # use albatrice::Input;
/// # fn main() {
/// let input: String = <Input>::new()
///     .msg("some message")
///     .cond(&|string| {
///         // Some condition
///         # return Ok(true)
///     })
///     .get().unwrap();
/// # }
/// ```
/// If needed, the condition can return an error,
/// which will stop all attempts to get input and
/// will return that error. However, because most
/// of the time, that is not needed, the default
/// error type is [Infallible].
