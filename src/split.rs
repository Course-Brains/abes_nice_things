/// This is a trait designed to [split](Split::split) things that
/// implement both [Read](std::io::Read) and [Write](std::io::Write)
/// into two separate things which each implement one of them.
/// For an example of the benefits, let's look at [TcpStream](std::net::TcpStream),
/// with [TcpStream](std::net::TcpStream) it can be useful to have it be written to
/// and read from in two different places. Under normal circumstances, the only way
/// to do that would be to clone it like this:
/// ```ignore
/// let (read, write) = (stream.try_clone().unwrap(), stream);
/// ```
/// However, this has a glaring issue. There is no guarantee that the people using
/// read and write won't missuse it. For example, someone who has the write half
/// may need to read something from it, and think "oh, it's just one thing, it will
/// be fine and won't affect anything" however, them taking that action removes the
/// guarantee that the read half is reading what it thinks it is, I don't like that.
/// As such, I made some types to enforce it. With those being [ReadHalf] and
/// [WriteHalf], which simply enforce only [writing](std::io::Write::write) to [WriteHalf]
/// and only [reading](std::io::Read::read) to [ReadHalf].
///
/// In relation to those, [Split](Split::split) simply creates them. And
/// [recombine](Split::recombine) consumes both halves to get the original value.

    /// [write](std::io::Write::write) in place of the original, and the
    /// other will [read](std::io::Read::read) in place of the original.
    /// For example:
    /// ```ignore
    /// let (read_half, write_half) = tcp_stream.split().unwrap();
    /// ```
    /// Will create the two distinct halves to the two variables named
    /// after them.
    ///
    /// The benefit of doing this is that this guarantees that there will
    /// only be one [Writer](std::io::Write) and one [Reader](std::io::Read).
    /// As opposed to simply cloning the original, which would allow both

    /// from the same source, will return the original, otherwise, it will
    /// return None. For more information on how to
    /// create those halves, see [split](Split::split).
    ///
    /// For example:
    /// ```no_run
    /// # use albatrice::Split;
    /// # use std::fs::File;
    /// # fn main() {
    /// let original = File::open("~/.vimrc").unwrap();
    /// // split consumes the original
    /// let (read, write) = original.split().unwrap();
    /// // recombine consumes the splits
    /// let recombined = File::recombine(read, write).unwrap();
    /// # }
    /// ```
    /// However, that only works if you are recombining splits from the same
    /// source, if they are different, [recombine](Split::recombine) will
    /// return [None].
    /// ```no_run
    /// # use albatrice::Split;
    /// # use std::fs::File;
    /// # fn main() {
    /// let original1 = File::open("~/.vimrc").unwrap();
    /// let original2 = File::open("~/.cargo/bin/rustup").unwrap();
    /// let (read1, _) = original1.split().unwrap();
    /// let (_, write2) = original2.split().unwrap();
    /// // invalid recombine
    /// assert!(File::recombine(read1, write2).is_none());
    /// # }
    /// ```
    /// Due to the read and write halves being from different sources,
    /// they cannot be recombined.
    ///
    /// In order to check if two halves are from the same source, they
    /// implement [PartialEq] and can be compared to one another:
    /// ```no_run
    /// # use albatrice::Split;
    /// # use std::fs::File;
    /// # fn main() {
    /// let original1 = File::open("~/.vimrc").unwrap();
    /// let original2 = File::open("~/.cargo/bin/rustup").unwrap();

    /// assert!(read2 == write2);
    /// assert!(read1 != write2);
    /// assert!(read2 != write1);

    /// However, while [ReadHalf] can be compared to [WriteHalf] and
    /// vice versa, comparing a [ReadHalf] and another [ReadHalf] (same
    /// for [WriteHalf], just not mentioning it), it will not check if
    /// they are from the same source, and will instead compare the
